//Consider the below series:
//0,0,2,1,4,2,6,3,8,4,10,5,12,6,14,7,16,8
//This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous term using the formula (x/2)
//Write a program to find the nth term in this series.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
